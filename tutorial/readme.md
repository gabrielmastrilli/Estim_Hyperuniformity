# Tutorial

## Content
The python file ``tutorial.py`` contains three examples:

- the first one estimates the hyperuniformity exponent of a Poisson point process in dimension two and plot the associated regression curve,
- the second one focuses on a cloacked and perturbed lattice by stable distribution in dimension two for which a prescribed hyperuniformity exponent (denoted alpha in the code) can be set,
- the third one computes the asymptotic confidence interval associated to the estimation of the hyperuniformity exponent for a Poisson point process.

The choice of the parameters (scales, number of tapers) is described in Section 4.1. of the companion paper.
