# Tutorial

## Content
We provide three tutorials in the python file ``tutorial.py``. 

- one for estimating the hyperuniformity exponent of a Poisson point process in dimension two
- one for estimating the hyperuniformity exponent of a cloacked and perturbed lattice by stable distribution in dimension two
- one for computing the asymptotic confidence interval associated to one estimation of the hyperuniformity exponent for a Poisson point process.

They use the multi-tapers, multi-scale estimators (with Hermite wavelets tapers) introduced in [''Estimating the hyperunformity exponent''](https://arxiv.org). 

## Companion paper 

For theoretical properties of the estimator, we refer to Sections 2-3 of the aforementionned paper, and for the choices of the parameters, we refer to Section 4.1.
