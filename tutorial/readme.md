# Tutorial

## Content
The python file ``tutorial.py`` contains three examples:

- the first one estimates the hyperuniformity exponent of a Poisson point process in dimension two and plot the associated regression curve,
- the second one focuses on a cloacked and perturbed lattice by stable distribution in dimension two for which a prescribed hyperuniformity exponent (denoted alpha) can be set,
- one for computing the asymptotic confidence interval associated to one estimation of the hyperuniformity exponent for a Poisson point process.

They use the multi-tapers, multi-scale estimators (with Hermite wavelets tapers) introduced in [''Estimating the hyperunformity exponent''](https://arxiv.org). 

## Companion paper 

For theoretical properties of the estimators, we refer to Sections 3 of the aforementioned paper, and concerning the choices of its parameters, we refer to Section 4.1.
