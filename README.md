> Estimating hyperuniformity exponent via multi-tapers (Hermites) spectral estimator, computing asymptotic confident intervals, sampling cloacked and alpha-stable perturbed lattices 

## Introduction

`EstimHyperuniformityAlpha` currently contains python functions that allows for computing an estimator of the hyperuniformity exponent of a point process, and an associated asymptotic confidence interval. It also contains code for sampling hyperuniform perturbed lattices with prescribed hyperuniformity exponent. 

## Dependencies

- `EstimHyperuniformityAlpha` works with [![Python >=3.8,<3.10](https://img.shields.io/badge/python->=3.8,<3.10-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/).
