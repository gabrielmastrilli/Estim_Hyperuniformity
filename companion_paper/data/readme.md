#  Data

We provide data that have been used for creating the figures of Section 4 of the companion paper [''Estimating the hyperunformity exponent''](https://arxiv.org).

## Content

- [./data/point_patterns](./data/point_patterns) contains the point realizations of the algae, one relization of a Matern hard-core point process, and one realization of a Ginibre point process.
  
-   [./data/estim_perturbed_lattices](./data/estim_perturbed_lattices) contains the estimated hyperuniformity exponent for perturbed lattices. The Figure 2 of the companion paper is based on these data.

- [./data/coverage](./data/coverage) contains the data of Table 1 in the file ``nb_inside.txt``. The file ``nb_inside_ind.txt`` contains the coverage probability using the asymptotic covariance matrix defined in equation (15) of the companion paper.

- [./data/estim_matched](./data/estim_matched) contains the estimated hyperuniformity exponent for matched point processes. The Figure 3 of the companion paper is based on these data.
